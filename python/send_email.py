# Create a CII invoice and email it with the InvoiceXML API, in one call.
# Builds and validates the invoice exactly like POST /v1/create/cii, then
# sends it as an attachment from your own domain. This sends a real email.
# The answer is the message id of the email, not the file.
#
# Before the first run, add and verify your domain:
# https://www.invoicexml.com/account/sending-domains
# Your plan must include email delivery: https://www.invoicexml.com/pricing
#
# Get API key: https://www.invoicexml.com/account/authentication
# Docs:        https://www.invoicexml.com/docs/api/create/cii/email
#
# Dependency:  pip install requests

# Raw key only, without the "Bearer " prefix (it is added below).
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Totals and the VAT breakdown are calculated from the line items.
